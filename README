This is a quick little cross-platform demo that does
file hot reloading.

The program reads and displays the contents of
data.txt ( only 1 KB though! ), and updates live
based on the file's modification / write time.

NOTE: The flickering on Windows is due to my shoddy
	  implementation of my libncurses functions.

	  On Linux it does not flicker, but otherwise on both
	  OSes it exhibits the correct behavior.
